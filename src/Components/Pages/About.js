            <h3>REDUCING WASTE</h3>
            <p>It is estimated that around 600 million tonnes of products and materials enter the UK economy each year and only 115 million tonnes are recycled at the end of their life. Our Reducing Waste label offers an edit of refillables, alternatives to single-use plastic items and products which have been created by upcycling, recycling and regenerating waste into innovative new materials, components and ingredients.
What can you do?
- Purchase products made from recycled materials and ingredients
- Use refillable products – washing liquid to perfume, the options are out there
- Reduce your use of single-use plastic
By saying no to single-use items and choosing products made from recycled materials, you’re helping to preserve natural resources.
Did you know?
8 million tonnes of plastic are dumped in our oceans every year, and each day around 7 million coffee cups are thrown away in the UK.</p>
